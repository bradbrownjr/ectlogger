- **Database**: SQLAlchemy ORM (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 + Magic Link email authentication
- **Real-Time**: WebSockets for live updates
- **Email**: SMTP with HTML templates

## 👥 User Roles

ECTLogger has two types of roles: **global roles** (system-wide) and **net roles** (per-net assignments).

### Global Roles
- 🛡️ **Admin** - Full system access, user management, view all nets, configure custom fields
- 👤 **User** - Create nets, check into nets, receive notifications
- 👁️ **Guest** - View-only access to public nets (no account required)

### Net Roles
When a user creates a net, they automatically become its **NCS (Net Control Station)**. The net creator can then assign these roles to other users for that specific net:

- 👑 **NCS** - Full control of the net: start/close, manage check-ins, assign roles
- 📋 **Logger** - Log check-ins and manage station status
- 📡 **Relay** - Check in stations on behalf of others (for contacts NCS can't hear directly)

This means any registered user can run their own nets without needing admin privileges. A user might be a regular participant in one net while serving as NCS for another.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities

### Multi-Frequency Net Support
Net loggers typically track one frequency, but ECT and SKYWARN nets often move between frequencies to meet participants where they are. ECTLogger tracks:
- Multiple frequencies per net
- Active frequency indication
- Per-station frequency tracking
- Real-time frequency change notifications

### Station Status Tracking
Visual indicators for:
- ✅ Checked In
- 👂 Just Listening
- 📻 Available
- ⏸️ Away
- 👋 Checked Out
- 🔄 Recheck (returning stations)

### Role Assignments
- Designate NCS, loggers, and relay stations
- Multiple NCS support for large nets
- Relay station tracking for extended coverage

### Location Awareness
Streamline check-ins with automatic location detection:
- **Maidenhead Grid Square** - Users who enable location awareness see their 6-character grid square in the navbar
- **Auto-Fill on Check-In** - When a user checks into a net, their location field is automatically populated with their current grid square
- **NCS Auto-Fill** - When NCS enters a callsign, the system looks up the registered user and auto-fills their name, location (if they've enabled location awareness), and SKYWARN number
- **Privacy Respecting** - Location is only shared when the user explicitly enables it in their profile settings

### Statistics & Analytics
Track participation and performance with interactive charts:
- **Platform Statistics** - Total nets, check-ins, active operators, and trends over time
- **Net Statistics** - Per-net check-in counts, top operators, daily/weekly breakdowns
- **User Activity** - Personal check-in history, favorite nets, NCS service record
- **Participation Tracking** - See which nets operators check into most frequently

## 📋 Net Workflow

### 1. Create Net
- User creates a new net with name and description
- Define communication plan (frequencies, modes, talkgroups)
- Configure required and optional check-in fields
- Assign net roles (NCS, Logger, Relay) to other users
- Save as draft for later editing

### 2. Schedule Net (Optional)
- Set date, time, and timezone for the net
- Configure recurring schedule (daily, weekly, monthly)
- Set up **NCS rotation** - automatically assign NCS duties across scheduled instances
- System sends reminders to assigned NCS before their scheduled net
- Scheduled nets auto-start at the configured time

### 3. Start Net
- NCS starts the net manually, or it auto-starts if scheduled
- Email notifications sent to subscribers
- Real-time WebSocket connections established
- Guests can view, users can participate

### 4. Log Check-ins
- NCS or designated logger enters check-ins
- Stations can self-check-in via web interface
- Support for relay stations (checking in contacts NCS can't hear)
- Real-time updates to all connected clients
- Edit or delete check-ins as needed

### 5. Track Participation
- Monitor station status changes
- Track frequency usage per station
- Identify recheck stations
- View check-in timeline

### 6. Close Net
- NCS or logger closes the net
- Complete log generated automatically
- Log emailed to NCS in text format
- Net archived for reports and history

## 📦 Installation

See [MANUAL-INSTALLATION.md](MANUAL-INSTALLATION.md) for complete installation instructions.

### Quick Install

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x *.sh
./install.sh      # Automated installation
./configure.sh    # Interactive configuration
./start.sh        # Start the application
```

**Optional: Install as systemd service (Linux):**
```bash
./install-service.sh  # Install systemd service
sudo systemctl start ectlogger
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
.\start.ps1       # Automated installation and startup
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# 1. Install backend dependencies
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR: .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your settings
```

## 🔄 Migration

Use `migrate.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `migrate.ps1` (Windows) to change host addresses when moving between environments (e.g., LAN development to production) without modifying other configuration settings.

### Quick Migration Examples

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Production domain (with reverse proxy)
./migrate.sh --host ect.example.com

# LAN IP (development)
./migrate.sh --lan-ip 192.168.1.100
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Production domain (with reverse proxy)
.\migrate.ps1 -Host ect.example.com

# LAN IP (development)
.\migrate.ps1 -LanIP 192.168.1.100
```

The script automatically updates `backend/.env` and `frontend/.env`, and configures the Vite allowed hosts for security.

See [PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md](PRODUCTION-DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment instructions.
