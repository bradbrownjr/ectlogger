# ECTLogger

## A Modern Radio Net Logger

Whether you're running a casual weekly club net or coordinating a multi-agency emergency response, ECTLogger adapts to your needs. Start simple and grow into advanced features as your operations demand.

**For community nets**, keep things fun and engaging. Add a Topic of the Week to spark conversation, run polls to gather opinions, and let participants chat in real-time alongside the check-in log. The clean, modern interface makes logging effortless—no more wrestling with clunky desktop apps or decade-old web interfaces.

**For SKYWARN and weather nets**, capture what matters. Enable spotter number and weather observation fields to collect critical data from trained spotters. View check-in locations on an interactive map supporting entry of town and state, GPS coordinates, Maidenhead grid squares, UTM, and MGRS formats in the check-in's Location field — perfect for situational awareness during severe weather events.

**For ARES and emergency communications**, ECTLogger handles the complexity. Multiple NCS operators can work different frequencies simultaneously, with check-ins intelligently separated by band but logged together in one unified view. When the incident wraps up, generate ICS-309 Communications Logs with a single click for your after-action reports.

The responsive interface works beautifully on any device — from a phone in the field to a multi-monitor EOC workstation. Pop out the check-in list or chat into detachable windows within the browser to customize your workspace. Dark mode keeps things easy on the eyes during those long operational periods.

## 👥 User Roles

ECTLogger has two types of roles: **global roles** (system-wide) and **net roles** (per-net assignments).

### Global Roles

ECTLogger provides the following types of users:

| Role          | Description                                                                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🛡️**Admin** | Full system access, user management, view all nets, configure custom fields |
| 👤**User**    | Create nets, check into nets, receive notifications                         |
| 👁️**Guest** | View-only access to public nets (no account required)                       |

### Net Roles

When a user creates a net, they automatically become its **NCS (Net Control Station)**. The net creator can assign these roles to other users:


| Role                  | Description                                                   |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 👑**NCS**             | Full control: start/close net, manage check-ins, assign roles |
| 🤴**Secondary NCS**   | Additional NCS operators for multi-frequency nets             |
| 📋**Logger**          | Log check-ins and manage station status                       |
| 📡**Relay**           | Check in stations on behalf of others                         |

Any registered user can run their own nets!

### Station Status Tracking

Visual indicators for station status:

- ✅ Checked In
- 👂 Just Listening
- 📻 Available
- ⏸️ Away
- 👋 Checked Out
- 🔄 Recheck (returning stations)

A legend at the base of the check-in list identifies each status icon.

## 📋 Net Workflow

### 1. Create Net

Define your net with name, description, frequencies, and required fields. Assign roles and save as draft.

### 2. Schedule (Optional)

Set date/time, configure recurring schedule, and set up NCS rotation with automatic reminders.

### 3. Start Net

NCS starts manually or net auto-starts if scheduled. Email notifications sent to subscribers.

### 4. Log Check-ins

NCS or logger enters check-ins with real-time updates to all connected clients.

### 5. Close Net

Complete log generated automatically and emailed to NCS. Net archived for reports.
