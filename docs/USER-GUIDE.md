2. Click on a net to view details
3. If the net is open for check-ins, you'll see the check-in form

### Checking In

1. Open an active net
2. Fill in the check-in form:
   - Your callsign (auto-filled if logged in)
   - Your name (auto-filled from profile)
   - Your location (auto-filled if location awareness is enabled)
   - Any additional fields the NCS has configured
3. Click **Check In**

## Running a Net (NCS)

### Creating a Net

1. Click **Create Net** from the dashboard
2. Fill in the net details:
   - **Name** — Net name (e.g., "Monday Evening SKYWARN Net")
   - **Description** — Purpose and any special instructions
   - **Frequencies** — Add one or more frequencies/modes
   - **Scheduled Start Time** — Optional. If set, a countdown timer will display
3. Configure check-in fields (required and optional)
4. (Optional) Add a **Net Script** — formatted text NCS can reference during the net
5. Save as **Draft** or **Start** immediately

### Recurring Schedules

For nets that run regularly (weekly club nets, SKYWARN practice nets, etc.), create a schedule:

1. Click **Create Schedule** from the dashboard or Scheduler page
2. Configure the net details (same as creating a one-time net)
3. Set the **Recurrence Pattern**:
   - Day of the week (e.g., every Tuesday)
   - Start time
   - Timezone
4. (Optional) Set up **NCS Rotation** — assign multiple operators to take turns running the net
5. The system automatically creates draft nets according to your schedule

**NCS Rotation features:**
- Add multiple operators to the rotation pool
- View upcoming NCS assignments on the rotation calendar
- Request coverage or swap dates with other operators
- Override specific dates when needed

### Net Script

Create a standardized script for NCS operators to follow:

1. In the **Create Net** or **Create Schedule** form, go to the **Net Script** tab
2. Enter your script using the formatting toolbar (headings, bold, lists, etc.)
3. During the net, click the **📜 Script** button to open the script viewer

The script viewer is a floating window that can be:
- Resized and moved
- Minimized to save screen space
- Opened in a new browser tab for printing or larger display

Example uses:
- Preamble and ID script
- Weather safety messaging (SKYWARN)
- Emergency procedures and frequencies
- Traffic handling protocols

### Net Timers

The net header displays helpful timing information:

- **Countdown Timer** — For scheduled nets, shows time until start (e.g., "Starts in 2h 15m")
- **Duration Timer** — For active nets, shows elapsed time (e.g., "Duration: 1:23:45")

### Starting a Net

- Click the green **▶ Play** button on the Dashboard or NetView page
- A toast notification will remind you to start if you're viewing a draft/scheduled net

### Managing Check-ins

As NCS, you can:
- Enter check-ins for stations
- Edit or delete check-ins
- Update station status
- Track which frequency each station is on

#### Inline Editing

NCS and Loggers can edit check-in details directly in the table:

1. Click anywhere on a check-in row to enter edit mode
2. The row highlights and fields become editable text boxes
3. Click on the specific field you want to edit — it will auto-focus
4. Press **Tab** to move between fields within the same row
5. Press **Enter** to save changes, or **Escape** to cancel
6. Click outside the row to save and exit edit mode

This eliminates the need for a separate edit dialog for quick corrections.

### Detachable Windows

For multi-monitor setups or larger screens, you can pop out components into separate floating windows:

- **Check-in List** — Click the pop-out icon (↗) in the check-in table header
- **Chat** — Click the pop-out icon in the chat panel header

Detached windows can be:
- Resized by dragging edges or corners
- Moved anywhere on screen
- Minimized to a title bar
- Reattached by clicking the attach icon or closing the window

Your detach preferences are saved and restored when you return to the net.

### Multi-NCS Operations

For nets with multiple frequencies, you can have multiple NCS operators:

1. **Assign NCS Role** — Promote other users to NCS via the status dropdown
2. **Claim a Frequency** — Click a frequency chip to claim it as your monitored frequency
3. **Color Coding** — Each NCS is assigned a unique color:
   - 👑 **Crown** — Primary NCS (net owner)
   - 🤴 **Prince Crown** — Secondary NCS operators
   - Frequency chips and check-in rows are colored to match the monitoring NCS
4. **Check-ins** — When you check in a station, they're automatically assigned to your claimed frequency

### Assigning Roles

Delegate responsibilities:
- **NCS** — Full net control, can manage check-ins and claim frequencies
- **Logger** — Can log check-ins
- **Relay** — Can check in stations they can hear but you can't

### Real-time Chat

Each net has a built-in chat for coordination between participants:

- **Send messages** — Type in the chat input and press Enter or click Send
- **System messages** — See when stations check in/out (enable "Show activity in chat" in Profile settings)
- **Pop-out chat** — Detach the chat window to keep it visible while managing the net
- **Persistent history** — Chat messages are saved and visible to participants who join later

Chat is useful for:
- Coordinating between NCS operators on multi-frequency nets
- Quick questions or comments from participants
- Relaying traffic details without tying up voice frequencies
- Backup coordination during contests or emergency activations

### Filtering by Frequency

- **Ctrl+Click** a frequency chip to filter the check-in list
- NCS operators always remain visible regardless of filter
- Click **Show All** to clear the filter

### Community Net Features

For casual nets and roundtables, ECTLogger offers engagement tools:

#### Topic of the Week

Ask participants a discussion question:

1. In the net settings (Topic & Poll button), enter a **Topic Question**
2. When checking in, participants see the question and can type their response
3. Responses appear in the check-in list's "Topic" column
4. All responses are included in the emailed net log

#### Participant Poll

Run a quick poll with predefined options:

1. In the net settings (Topic & Poll button), enter a **Poll Question**
2. Add up to 5 **Poll Options** (e.g., "Yes", "No", "Maybe")
3. Participants select their answer via dropdown when checking in
4. Poll results are shown in the "Poll" column
5. The emailed net log includes a bar chart of poll results with percentages

Both Topic and Poll columns are only visible when configured for the net. System messages in chat announce when participants submit answers.

### Closing the Net

1. Click **Close Net**
2. A complete log is generated and emailed to you
3. The net is archived for future reference

### Exporting Logs

- **CSV Export** — Download check-ins as a spreadsheet
- **ICS-309 Export** — Official FEMA communication log format (enable in net settings)

## Statistics

View participation statistics:
- **Platform Stats** — Overall system activity
- **Net Stats** — Per-net participation trends
- **Your Activity** — Personal check-in history (also available in your Profile)

## Tips & Tricks

### Keyboard Shortcuts

**Check-in Form:**
- Press **Tab** to move between fields
- Press **Enter** to submit a check-in

**Inline Editing:**
- Press **Tab** to move between fields in the same row
- Press **Enter** to save changes
- Press **Escape** to cancel without saving

### Dark Mode

ECTLogger automatically follows your system's light/dark mode preference. If your device is set to dark mode, ECTLogger will display in dark mode — easier on the eyes during those late-night nets!

### Mobile Use

ECTLogger is fully responsive and works great on mobile devices. Use your phone or tablet in the field! The interface adapts to smaller screens while keeping all functionality accessible.

### Location Awareness

Enable location awareness in your profile to automatically fill in your Maidenhead grid square when checking in. This is especially useful for:
- Mobile operations where your location changes
- Field Day and portable setups
- SKYWARN spotters reporting from various locations

Your browser will ask for permission before sharing location data.

### Searching and Filtering

**Search Bar:** Type in the search field to filter check-ins by callsign, name, or location.

**Frequency Filtering:** If a net has multiple frequencies:
- **Ctrl+click** a frequency chip to filter the check-in list to only stations on that frequency
- Click again to remove the filter
- A "Clear Filter" chip appears when filtering is active
- NCS operators are always shown regardless of filter

This is handy for NCS operating split frequencies — focus on stations monitoring your frequency!

### Subscribing to Nets

Subscribe to nets you regularly participate in to receive email notifications when they start, close, or are about to begin. Click the bell icon on any net to toggle subscription.
